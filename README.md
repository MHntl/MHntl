👋 Hi, I’m Muhammet Hantal. I was born in 1992 and served in the Turkish Air Force. I am an electrical and aircraft electronics technician. However, I have now changed my career path to become a software developer.

👀 I’m interested in learning new technologies related to my occupation to improve myself. Jogging, watching movies, anime, learning about computer hardware components technology, playing video games, and repairing broken devices are my hobbies.

🌱 I’m currently learning React Native.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with people who value their colleagues and are teamwork-oriented.
